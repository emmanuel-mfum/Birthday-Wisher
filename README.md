# Birthday-Wisher
Python program that can send birthday wishes via email to friends and family.

The program will read a csv containing the name, emails and date of birth of different persons and will check if the current day 
corresponds to one of these dates inside the .csv file. If yes, using the information extracted from the .csv (the name and email),
the program will send to that person an email using one of the three templates in this project, inserting inside the template, the name
of the loved one/friend.

To run this program simply make sure to have the main.py file as well as the other .txt and .csv files inside the same directory and 
run main.py
